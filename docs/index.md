## Studio Mission

Traditional martial arts train the student not only in physical skills for combat, but also mental skills – the drive to push forward, the resilience to bounce back, and the intellectual curiosity to dig deeper – for daily life.

The _dojo_ is more than a space for practicing the physical skills, it is the underlying set of social relationships – vertical between instructor and student, horizontal between peers – for fostering the mental ones.

The mission of _Dragon and Crane Dojo_ is to provide a community that develops the student at all levels – physical, emotional, intellectual, and social – to meet today’s challenges.


## Style and Lineage

#### _Karate: A Tradition of Adaptation_

Centuries ago, the Ryukyu Kingdom on the island of Okinawa adapted the _kempo_ of its Chinese trading partners to its native martial arts into a system called _te_.

Over time, each region – and sometimes even individual aristocratic families – began to develop their own signature styles. One such was the Motobu clan, who adapted traditional Okinawan dance with their combat into their Motobu-ryu style.

After Okinawa became part of Japan, several of its traditional _te_ styles were further adapted by Japan and Korea, contributing to _karate_ and _taekwondo_, respectively.

Born in Okinawa and trained in a foundation of Motobu-ryu, _Ken Nagayama_ immigrated to southern California in 1976 and adapted boxing, taekwondo, and aikido to found his own dojo in 1988.

In 2021, _David Chung_, a 2nd dan student of master Nagayama, continued the tradition of adapting his own experiences both on and off the mat into a new kind of curriculum at Dragon and Crane Dojo.

## Instructor

David Hakyong Chung (정학용) began training in karate at age 7 under master Ken Nagayama. He left home for college with a 2nd dan black belt and a strong foundation from which to branch into other physical disciplines: Brazilian capoeira, Chinese lion dance, northern Shaolin, and wing chun, as well as a aerial circus arts.

Equally important to his pedagogy are his experiences in Agile software development, Toastmasters public speaking, improv theater, the American college prep system, and the Korean hagwon/EdTech scene.

All these disparate elements have been adapted into a cohesive, multilayered curriculum that comprises Dragon and Crane Dojo.
