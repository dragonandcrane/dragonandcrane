2024-04-04 Notes on Setup and Intent

To start, this project will be a sandbox to experiment with
 - Github pages: web hosting
 - Jekyll: static content generation
 - React: frontend framework
 - Github web editor: browser-based IDE

Once said experiments have sufficiently progressed:
 - they will move to Dragon-and-Crane-Dojo organization to serve as foundation for dojo internship programs
 - this repo's contents will be replaced with my personal content
 - this repo's Github pages will be DNS mapped to `chung-sensei.dragonandcranedojo.com` (while `dragonandcrane.dragonandcranedojo.com` would be the obvious choice, it doesn't flow well).
